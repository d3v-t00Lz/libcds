/* Special use-case singly-linked list
 *
 * Useful when you need:
 *   - A disposible, short-lived queue
 *   - That performs well in real-time code
 *   - That does not free old memory until the entire data structure is freed
 *   - That does not allocate memory unless being appended to
 *   - That can accomodate multiple types
 *   - The application and/or hardware is sensitive to cache performance
 *   - The application does not iterate through the queue very quicly
 *
 * Stores metadata and data of arbitrary sizes interleaved in a single
 * allocation of memory.
