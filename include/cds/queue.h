/* A FIFO queue data structure
 * If you need a LIFO/stack, use CDSList{Append,Pop}
 *
 * Note that the underlyihng data is stored in an array-of-arrays rather
 * than a linked list for efficiency and speed.
 *
 * Terminology:
 *   - left:   The side of the queue that objects enter
 *   - right:  The side of the queue that objects leave
 *
 * @objSize:   The sizeof() the object type to be stored in this queue.
 * @shardSize: The count of objects to allocate each 2nd dimension of @data
 * @len:       The length of the queue, specifically the count of objects stored
 * @max:       The lengith of the underlying memory allocated for the queue
 *             before it will have to be grown.  Specifically the max count of
 *             objects that could be stored.
 * @lptr1:     The left pointer for the 1st dimension of @data
 * @lptr2:     The left pointer for the 2nd dimension of @data
 * @rptr1:     The right pointer for the 1st dimension of @data
 * @rptr2:     The right pointer for the 2nd dimension of @data
 * @data:      The objects being stored, as an array-of-arrays of raw bytes
 * @valueFree: A function pointer to be called on each queue item to free any
 *             pointers nested within.  If the object contains no pointers or
 *             the pointers are still referenced by other objects, pass NULL
 *             for this argument.

 *              resize automatically as it grows..
 * @shardSize:  The size of each 2nd dimension of the array-of-arrays
 *              If the intent is to populate with a known number objects
